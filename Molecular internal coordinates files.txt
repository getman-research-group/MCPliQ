Line 1: Number of atoms in the molecule
Lines 2 and beyond: These lines are divided into a maximum of 7 columns, each of which contains bonding information.

	Column 1: Atom identity (element symbol)
	
	Column 2: "Bonded_to" variable is an integer value signifying which atom the current atom is bonded to. By default, the first atom is always said to be bonded to itself.
	
	Column 3: "Bond_length" is the bond length, in Angstroms, between the current atom and the atom being bonded to (identified in column 2).
	
	Column 4: "Third_atom" variable is an integer value signifying the atom with which a bond angle will be made, 
			  in addition to the current atom and the atom identified in column 2. 
			  For example, in the above example file, look at the fourth line.
			  This carbon atom will be making a bond angle of ~110 degrees with itself, the second atom (ID'd in column 2), and the first atom (ID'd in column 4)
	
	Column 5: "Bond_angle" is the bond angle, in degrees, between the current atom, the bonded_to atom (ID'd in column 2), and the third_atom atom (ID'd in column 4)
	
	Column 6: "Fourth_atom" variable is an integer value signifying the atom with which the three previously identified atoms (current atom, columns 2 and 4)
			  will make a dihedral angle with.
			  For example, in the above example file, look at the fifth line.
			  This hydrogen will be making a dihedral angle of ~300 degrees with itself, the first atom (ID'd in column 2), the second atom (ID'd in column 4),
			  and the third atom (ID'd in column 6).
			  
	Column 7: "Dihedral_angle" is the dihedral angle, in degrees, between the current atom, the bonded_to atom (column 2), the third_atom atom (column 4),
			  and the fourth_atom atom (column 6)


A user can build their own files if the geometry of the molecule in question is known.
