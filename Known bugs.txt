///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Number of known bugs: 3


1)  The translation and rotation moves don't work with molecules with more than 3 atoms.

2)  If the surface and a fluid molecule have one or more of the same elements, the atom order in the surface's POSCAR
	and the fluid molecule's internal coordinates file must match, or else the rotation/translation moves may not happen correctly.
	What may happen instead is an unnecessary translation during a rotation move, or, during a translation move, two atoms in a molecule may
	switch places (Ex: H-O-H becomes H-H-O)
	This has to do with an as-of-yet unresolved error that's most likely in the replacement_sorter() function.
	
	For example, if the surface is a water surface, the fluid molecule is water, and the POSCAR's atom order is O H
	water's internal coordinates file (for fluid molecule placement) must have an atom order of O H, too.
	I haven't found a single pattern for when this occurs, but if either of the two errors described above occur,
	rearrange the atom order of either the POSCAR (easier) or the fluid molecule's internal coordinates file (harder, especially for anything larger than ~4 or 5 atoms).

3)  (Not really a bug, but...) The bond angle perturbation move isn't working yet.
