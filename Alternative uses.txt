1) Bulk placement of random waters (or other fluid molecules) around a surface with LAMMPS data file generation		




This section goes over the necessary procedure for generating a randomly positioned and oriented water (or other fluid molecule) environment in a given volume over a user-specified surface.

			
					
					
					The following is an example master_input.txt file set up for bulk random water placement around the supplied 18x18x3 Pt surface (POSCAR_pt18183nh3.txt)
							
							
							
Falling particles (1 or 0): 1
Resubmit (1 or 0): 0
Write LAMMPS file (1 or 0): 1
LAMMPS file extension: .water
Input POSCAR name: POSCAR_pt18183nh3.txt
Number of different types of surface particles: 3

Move attempt termination limit: 1000
Maximum scaling factor: 100
Minimum scaling factor: 1.1
Minimum z-coordinate: 6
Maximum z-coordinate: 48

Move probabilities [%]
Translation: 100
Rotation: 0
Bond angle perturbation: 0

Temperature [K]: 300
Anneal (1 or 0): 0
Initial temperature [K]: 1000
Begin at iteration: 0
End at iteration: 80
Max iterations: 0
Maximum translation distance [A]: 2.0

Number of different types of fluid molecules: 1
2400 water.txt



****EXPLANATION OF THE ABOVE****

The lines which require unique values for bulk placement of molecules are:

     1) Write LAMMPS file
		To generate a LAMMPS data file, set this equal to 1
	 
	 2) LAMMPS file extension
		Set this equal to anything following a period. Example values are:
		.txt
		.water
		.anything
		
	 3) Maximum scaling factor
	    For random bulk placement of fluid molecules, set this to a large value, such as 100. The reason for this is to ensure
		a fluid molecule's placement attempt isn't aborted because it's too far from anything else. This allows for the
		volume above the surface to be filled more uniformly.
		I set this to 100 in the example above, but a larger value may be needed for a larger system.
		
		Use the supplied Excel file (Minimum and maximum distances.xlsx) to get a better idea of the effect of this parameter.
	 
	 4) Minimum scaling factor
		I keep this set to 1.1.
		If overlapping can be allowed, set this to 0.
		
		Use the supplied Excel file (Minimum and maximum distances.xlsx) to get a better idea of the effect of this parameter.
	 
	 5) Minimum z-coordinate
		Set this to a value above the surface. If this is set to a value within the surface but the minimum scaling factor isn't 0,
		the fluid molecules will still be placed above the surface (not within it).
	 
	 6) Maximum z-coordinate
	 Set this to a value a little below the top of the input POSCAR's unit cell.
	 
	 
	 7) Max iterations
	 Set this equal to 0 if a random water (or other fluid molecule) environment is the only thing needed.
	 
	 
	 
All other lines still require values, but the outcome of the simulation doesn't depend on the value itself, so any value can be used.

2) LAMMPS Data File Information


This section goes over any differences between a LAMMPS data file generated by MCPliQ and one generated by another application, such as Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD).

There are three minor differences:

-In MCPliQ-generated LAMMPS data files, an 'X' or a 'Y' is left in place of any value which will later have to be supplied by the user.

-Each molecule is assumed to have one bond type, angle type, and dihedral type, if it has any at all.

-Atom, bond, angle, and dihedral descriptions follow the format 'molecule_N', where N is replaced by the place in which the given molecule appears in the
 user-specified fluid molecules list at the bottom master_input.txt.
 
	For example, 'Pt_-1' denotes a platinum atom belonging to the original surface (the -1 indicates association with the surface)
	           molecule_0 denotes a bond, angle, or dihedral associated with the first molecule in the list at the bottom of master_input.txt.
			   molecule_1 denotes a bond, angle, or dihedral associated with the second molecule in the list at the bottom of master_input.txt.
			   And so on...
